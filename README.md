# giphy-project
This page was completed using HTML, JavaScript (jQuery), the GIPHY API, and Bootstrap.

The sports buttons at the top were dynamically created using jQuery, and when they are clicked,10 still GIFS are loaded from the GIPHY API.

If you click on a GIF, it then animates and continues playing until you click on that GIF again.

A new topic can be added to the sports list at the top by typing in a new sport. A jQuery function then adds the new topic to the list of buttons at the top, and it has the same functionality as the previously listed buttons. 

The styling on the page is based off of a color scheme that was created with Adobe Color.

The responsive design was created using Bootstrap, which allows the GIFS to stretch one column on smaller screens and then split into two columns on larger screens.
